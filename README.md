# 📊 Pinnacle Meta Ads Campaign Dataset – Marketing Analytics & Performance Optimization eda

## tools : Python,numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,excel,pivot

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a Meta Ads campaign dataset containing:

- 10000+ rows (Ads)
- ~50 structured columns (after preprocessing)
- Embedded JSON targeting specifications
- Campaign, Ad Set, and Ad-level performance metrics

The dataset required preprocessing due to:
- Semi-structured JSON columns
- Redundant system-generated metrics
- Hourly and weekday breakdown columns
- High null-value fields
- Mixed data types

The primary objective was to prepare the dataset in Excel and perform advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python to generate actionable marketing insights.

# 🧹 Phase 1: Excel Data Cleaning & Structuring

## 🔹 JSON Column Handling
- Extracted targeting information (age range, interests, behaviors, geo-location).
- Removed raw nested JSON columns after flattening key fields.
- Reduced structural complexity for analytical clarity.

## 🔹 Data Standardization
- Converted dates, currency, and numeric fields to appropriate formats.
- Ensured Ad ID uniqueness.
- Cleaned text-based NaN values to avoid Python parsing issues.

## 🔹 Column Reduction & Optimization
- Removed columns with 80–90% null values.
- Dropped hourly breakdown columns (recalculable in Python).
- Deleted weekday-specific columns (can be derived from date).
- Removed derivable metrics such as Ad Rank, Top 25% CPC etc.
- Focused dataset on core KPIs.

## 🔹 Feature Engineering

Created new calculated metrics:

- Engagement Rate (24hr, 7-day, overall)
- Conversion Rate (24hr, 7-day, overall)
- Monthly performance column
- Date range & time-based derived columns

# 📐 KPI & Metric Formulas Used in Analysis

Below are the key formulas used to calculate performance metrics in Excel and Python.

---

## 🔹 Core Performance Metrics

### 1️⃣ Click-Through Rate (CTR)

CTR (%) = (Clicks / Impressions) × 100

---

### 2️⃣ Cost Per Click (CPC)

CPC = Total Spend / Total Clicks

---

### 3️⃣ Conversion Rate (CR)

Conversion Rate = Conversions / Clicks

OR (if calculated from impressions)

Conversion Rate = Conversions / Impressions

---

### 4️⃣ Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

CPA = Total Spend / Total Conversions

---

### 5️⃣ Cost Per Landing Page View (CPLPV)

CPLPV = Total Spend / Landing Page Views

---

### 6️⃣ Engagement Rate

Engagement Rate = Total Engagements / Impressions

---

### 7️⃣ Return on Investment (ROI)

ROI (%) = ((Revenue – Spend) / Spend) × 100

---

## 🔹 Time-Based Metrics

### 8️⃣ Daily Performance

Daily Impressions = SUM(Impressions grouped by Date)

Daily Conversions = SUM(Conversions grouped by Date)

Daily CPC = Daily Spend / Daily Clicks

---

### 9️⃣ Monthly Performance

Monthly Spend = SUM(Spend grouped by Month)

Monthly Conversion Rate = Monthly Conversions / Monthly Clicks

---

## 🔹 Benchmark Comparison Metrics

### 10️⃣ Performance vs Group Average

Metric Ratio = Ad Metric / Group Average Metric

If:
- < 0.85 → Underperforming
- > 1.15 → Overperforming

---

### 11️⃣ Performance vs Top 25 Percentile

Metric Ratio = Ad Metric / Top 25% Benchmark

Used to identify high-performing ads relative to best performers.

---

## 🔹 Decision Threshold Logic

### Continue Criteria:
- CTR above average
- CPC below average
- Conversion Rate above benchmark

### Pause Criteria:
- CTR near average
- Moderate CPC
- Inconsistent conversions

### Discontinue Criteria:
- Conversion Rate < 0.01
- High CPA
- Zero payments despite spend

---

## 🔹 Example Excel Formula Implementations

CTR:
= (Clicks / Impressions) * 100

CPC:
= Spend / Clicks

Conversion Rate:
= Conversions / Clicks

CPA:
= Spend / Conversions

ROI:
= ((Revenue - Spend) / Spend) * 100
